# AccountGeolocationLWC
This is the LWC equivalent of the Account Geolocation app in Trailhead that is currently only available with Aura components.

## Aura Conversion
This repo represents an initial Aura conversion that I did in preparation for my new Pluralsight course, "Building Your First Lightning Web Component For Salesforce". In the module about "Converting Aura Components", course viewers will learn of the mistakes I made when converting this Trailhead app. Therefore, it is only slightly similar to the application that will be built in that course.

## Lead Locator LWC App
Anyone wanting to access the final code for that course, <a href="https://github.com/saramorgan/LeadLocatorLWCApp" target="_blank"> can access it here</a>.
